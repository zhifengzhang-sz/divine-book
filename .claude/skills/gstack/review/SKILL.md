## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get gstack_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple gstack sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every AskUserQuestion MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current plan/task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **gstack itself** (not the user's app), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with gstack and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**gstack issues:** browse command fails/wrong output, snapshot missing elements, skill instructions unclear or misleading, binary crash/hang, unhelpful error message, any rough edge or annoyance — even minor stuff.
**NOT gstack issues:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run: `mkdir -p ~/.gstack/contributor-logs && open ~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-snapshot-ref-gap`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

# Pre-Landing PR Review

You are running the `/review` workflow. Analyze the current branch's diff against main for structural issues that tests don't catch.

---

## Step 1: Check branch

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch.
2. If on `main`, output: **"Nothing to review — you're on main or have no changes against main."** and stop.
3. Run `git fetch origin main --quiet && git diff origin/main --stat` to check if there's a diff. If no diff, output the same message and stop.

---

## Step 2: Read the checklist

Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`.

**If the file cannot be read, STOP and report the error.** Do not proceed without the checklist.

---

## Step 2.5: Check for Greptile review comments

Read `.claude/skills/review/greptile-triage.md` and follow the fetch, filter, classify, and **escalation detection** steps.

**If no PR exists, `gh` fails, API returns an error, or there are zero Greptile comments:** Skip this step silently. Greptile integration is additive — the review works without it.

**If Greptile comments are found:** Store the classifications (VALID & ACTIONABLE, VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED, FALSE POSITIVE, SUPPRESSED) — you will need them in Step 5.

---

## Step 3: Get the diff

Fetch the latest main to avoid false positives from a stale local main:

```bash
git fetch origin main --quiet
```

Run `git diff origin/main` to get the full diff. This includes both committed and uncommitted changes against the latest main.

---

## Step 4: Two-pass review

Apply the checklist against the diff in two passes:

1. **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, Race Conditions & Concurrency, LLM Output Trust Boundary, Enum & Value Completeness
2. **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** Conditional Side Effects, Magic Numbers & String Coupling, Dead Code & Consistency, LLM Prompt Issues, Test Gaps, View/Frontend

**Enum & Value Completeness requires reading code OUTSIDE the diff.** When the diff introduces a new enum value, status, tier, or type constant, use Grep to find all files that reference sibling values, then Read those files to check if the new value is handled. This is the one category where within-diff review is insufficient.

Follow the output format specified in the checklist. Respect the suppressions — do NOT flag items listed in the "DO NOT flag" section.

---

## Step 5: Output findings

**Always output ALL findings** — both critical and informational. The user must see every issue.

- If CRITICAL issues found: output all findings, then for EACH critical issue use a separate AskUserQuestion with the problem, then `RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [one-line reason]`, then options (A: Fix it now, B: Acknowledge, C: False positive — skip).
  After all critical questions are answered, output a summary of what the user chose for each issue. If the user chose A (fix) on any issue, apply the recommended fixes. If only B/C were chosen, no action needed.
- If only non-critical issues found: output findings. No further action needed.
- If no issues found: output `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

### Greptile comment resolution

After outputting your own findings, if Greptile comments were classified in Step 2.5:

**Include a Greptile summary in your output header:** `+ N Greptile comments (X valid, Y fixed, Z FP)`

Before replying to any comment, run the **Escalation Detection** algorithm from greptile-triage.md to determine whether to use Tier 1 (friendly) or Tier 2 (firm) reply templates.

1. **VALID & ACTIONABLE comments:** These are already included in your CRITICAL findings — they follow the same AskUserQuestion flow (A: Fix it now, B: Acknowledge, C: False positive). If the user chooses A (fix), reply using the **Fix reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include inline diff + explanation). If the user chooses C (false positive), reply using the **False Positive reply template** (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history.

2. **FALSE POSITIVE comments:** Present each one via AskUserQuestion:
   - Show the Greptile comment: file:line (or [top-level]) + body summary + permalink URL
   - Explain concisely why it's a false positive
   - Options:
     - A) Reply to Greptile explaining why this is incorrect (recommended if clearly wrong)
     - B) Fix it anyway (if low-effort and harmless)
     - C) Ignore — don't reply, don't fix

   If the user chooses A, reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history.

3. **VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED comments:** Reply using the **Already Fixed reply template** from greptile-triage.md — no AskUserQuestion needed:
   - Include what was done and the fixing commit SHA
   - Save to both per-project and global greptile-history

4. **SUPPRESSED comments:** Skip silently — these are known false positives from previous triage.

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS cross-reference

Read `TODOS.md` in the repository root (if it exists). Cross-reference the PR against open TODOs:

- **Does this PR close any open TODOs?** If yes, note which items in your output: "This PR addresses TODO: <title>"
- **Does this PR create work that should become a TODO?** If yes, flag it as an informational finding.
- **Are there related TODOs that provide context for this review?** If yes, reference them when discussing related findings.

If TODOS.md doesn't exist, skip this step silently.

---

## Important Rules

- **Read the FULL diff before commenting.** Do not flag issues already addressed in the diff.
- **Read-only by default.** Only modify files if the user explicitly chooses "Fix it now" on a critical issue. Never commit, push, or create PRs.
- **Be terse.** One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.
- **Only flag real problems.** Skip anything that's fine.
- **Use Greptile reply templates from greptile-triage.md.** Every reply includes evidence. Never post vague replies.
